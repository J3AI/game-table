####The idea
Most board games share several basic components: boards, tokens, dice and cards. Given this shared architecture, a single gaming application can power numerous different board games. 

####Asynchronous Rails
In order to incorporate asynchronous updates of both tokens movement and chat this application uses the [Pusher](http://pusher.com/) and [Sync](https://github.com/chrismccord/sync).


####Token movement 
[JQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/) dragabble and dragstop functions were used to both move the tokens and mark their placement back on the board. On every dragstop, the location of the board is saved as x/y coordinates in the database.

    $(".token").on("dragstop", function(event, ui){
      var x = $(this).position().left;
      var y = $(this).position().top;
      var tokenId = $(this).data("id");
      var valuesToSubmit = "x_coordinate=" + x + "&y_coordinate="+ y;
      $.post("tokens/"+tokenId+"/move", valuesToSubmit, function(){});
    });

####Screen sharing 
Each token is a partial that is synced via pusher to any other user sharing in that game.

  	<div class="tabletop">
      <div class="truecenter">
        <div class="board">
          <img src="<%= image_path(@game.board.image) %>">
          <% @game.tokens.each do |token| %>
          	<%= sync partial: 'token', resource: token %>
          <% end %>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    
At each dragstop, the following action fires in the tokens controller, updating the token position for both the current user and any other users connected to the game.
    
      def move
        @token.update(:x_coordinate => params[:x_coordinate].to_i, :y_coordinate =>
        						        params[:y_coordinate].to_i)
    	sync_update @token
    	redirect_to game_path(@token.game.secure_room_code)
  	  end


####Chat and dice rolling

Messaging works in a very similar way. The following action fires in the messages controller every time a message get sent between users.

  	def create
      @game = Game.find_by(secure_room_code: params[:secure_room_code])
      @message = @game.messages.create(:content => params[:message][:content],
                                       :name => params[:message][:name],
                                       :source => "user")
      sync_new @message, scope: @game
      redirect_to game_path(@message.game.secure_room_code)
  	end
  	

And this action in turns updates the messeging sync partial on all the of connected users screens. 


    <div class="messages-box">
      <ul id="chat">
        <% @game.messages.each do |message| %>
          <%= sync partial: 'message', resource: message %>
        <% end %>
        <%= sync_new partial: 'message', resource: Message.new, scope: @game %>
      </ul>
    </div>



####Security without users
The application has no users. Instead, players are de facto authorized through the unique game url. For example 

	http://gametable.co/games/56b3f2d83c82304ce036cec5c97435d7 

Every time a game is initiated, a unique url like the one above gets created. This url is created in the GameBuilder model

  	def checkers 
      @checkers = GameBuilder.build_checkers
      redirect_to game_path(@checkers.secure_room_code)
  	end

And routes as follows 

	get  '/games/:secure_room_code' => 'games#show', :as => "game"
	
and the route gets created dynamically


####Game play

For games like checkers, where the pieces can change form during the game (e.g. getting kinged), the application has the following methodology 



#### Setting the board

seed_dump



####Deploying

spike


####DB maintenance 
cron job using whenever gem 

####Front end styling 

style/eternity
